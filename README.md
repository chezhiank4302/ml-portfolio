# Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository is where I document my journey of building **end-to-end machine learning projects** across core ML areas. Instead of focusing on isolated algorithms, each project here is built the way ML work happens in the real world — starting from understanding the problem and the data, all the way to modeling, evaluation, and insights.


## What you’ll find here

* Projects that cover the full ML lifecycle, not just model training
* Clear problem statements and exploratory data analysis
* Thoughtful feature engineering and baseline models
* Careful evaluation with the right metrics and trade-offs
* Interpretability and practical takeaways, not just accuracy scores

Each project is treated as something I’d be comfortable explaining to a teammate or stakeholder.


## How this repository is organized

Projects are grouped by topic so it’s easy to explore a specific area of machine learning:

├── utils/                       # Reusable helper functions

Each individual project follows a consistent structure, so the focus stays on the problem, not on navigating the code.

## Tools and stack

Most of the work is done in Python, using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, with XGBoost or LightGBM where it makes sense. Notebooks are used for exploration, and reusable logic is kept in scripts to keep things clean and reproducible.

## Why this repo exists

This repository serves as:

* A portfolio for applied machine learning roles
* A personal reference for well-structured ML projects
* A foundation for more advanced work in ML systems and GenAI

I’ll continue to add projects over time, keeping the bar high for quality and completeness.
